              <p>Abraham Lincoln led our country through its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy. Lincoln managed in the process of saving the Union and abolishing slavery to define a more perfect Union in terms of liberty, justice, and economic equality that rallied the nation behind him.
